InheritableTemplates
====================

Looks for templates and partials to render in the entire controller inheritance chain.

Say you have:

  DocumentsController < ApplicationController
  ArticlesController < DocumentsController

and a view file at:

  app/views/documents/list.html.erb

If you request articles/list, and app/views/articles/list.html.erb doesn't exist, this
plugin will render app/views/documents/list.html.erb for you.


## Usage

Just drop it in your plugins folder, everything happens automatically.
